# Ganymede

_Ganymede is my first foray into making a game with sdl2 and c++. I hope to eventually abstract parts of it out to create a framework for easily creating new multiplatform applications for sdl._

## Compiling & Building

### Linux

The dependencies for linux can be sufficed with the following command:

- `sudo apt install cmake g++ libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev`

Associated scripts for building have been included.

- `bash scripts/build.sh` or `bash scripts/buildRun.sh` to compile from source.

### Windows

_There are no current windows build scripts. Please consider contributing :)_
